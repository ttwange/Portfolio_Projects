# Portfolio_Projects
This are End_2_End projects

This repo will contain projects mainly in data, from data analytics to data enginering and ML projects.

1. COVID PORFOLIO PROJECT.SQL

  The 1st project was on Covid porfolio project that is based on sql.
  The dataset used is CovidDeath.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx from the WORLD   HEALTH ORGANIZATION(WHO). The main question I was trying to answer, was on
  the spread of covid, the survival rate and general spread of covid in the population.
  
  
2. Housing Data cleaning with SQL.
 
  The 2ND project was on Housing Data Cleaning project that is based on           extensive SQL. The dataset used is Nashville Housing Data for Data                       Cleaning.xlsx from Kaggle. The main goal of this project was to show my data cleaning skills in a messy data using SQL.
 
3. CIA data anlysis.ipynb

  The 3rd project was on analysing CIA factbook data project that is based on extensive SQL. This project was more of an insight project, where I used the data to answer real world question about population, cities and climate change 

4. Data Modelling with postgres db
 
 In this project i worked on a simple data modelling project, where i practised on data modelling. I loaded data from a single source into postgres database locally.

Dateset : reserve_asset.csv , loans.csv and capial_asset.csv

5. Star Schema Design and Data modelling 

The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries. The star schema gets its name from the physical model's resemblance to a star shape with a fact table at its center and the dimension tables surrounding it representing the star's points. In this project, I will be converting schema into star schema.
